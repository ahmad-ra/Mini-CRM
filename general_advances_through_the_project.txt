_I used circle CI, as it was advised for a small start-up of 1~3 developers.

_I intended to not put the .circleci/config.yaml file to see how the tool will act, it turns out that it created it for me!

_I saw a tut for someone doing tests on a python app and integrating to circle_ci config, will do it on Laravel

_Setting env vars in circle_ci project settings to include docker_hub username/password

_(from docs)
If you are using Workflows, jobs must have unique names within the .circleci/config.yml file.If you are not using workflows, the jobs map must contain a job named build. This build job is the default entry-point for a run that is triggered by a push to your VCS provider.

_Docker build -t repo 
-t: tag the resulting image to refer to the repo

_there is a dot in the end of docker build command

dockerhub uname: ahmrash	


_nothing worked for docker with circle ci for laravel, will try running laravel on docker first without ci.

_The {{username}} should be the username of the dockerhub account, not github. SSHIT SHITTTT

_The image tag should be EXACTLY {{userneme}}/{{image name}}:{{version}}
Lw m3mltsh version fa lw7do 7ydeeha tag latest

_docker build -t $DockerHubUsername /mini-crm: .
echo $DockerHubPass | docker login -u $DockerHubUsername --password-stdin
docker push $DockerHubUsername/mini-crm:


_docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app composer install

Kda nazzel el composer fe container 

_Eldonia meshyet fl Docker. Will try with Circle CI now

_free plan of circle ci doesn't include docker layer caching. Bo5ala

_balash php latest fl docker image 75lleeha 7.2 mthln 3shan el requirements fe composer.json 3ayza php ^7

_ I also have to downgrade mysql image to match the required in this project. Will try 5.7.33-ram

_docker containers initiated by docker run exit after the command, so any later commands (docker exec) referencing to that container will fail as the container is not running!. 
A work around was to restart the container after first initiation (docker restart cont_name) then in the same command do && your needed script.

_exit code is 137, which may be a killing by the host (circle ci) due to being out_of_memory in the free plan. Will make sure by seeing (docker inspect container_name)


_running everything in one job is doable but not a good practice, you have to slice tasks in multiple jobs. BUT each job is ephermal, and you must have all data and files from the 1st job accessible to the 2nd job, and the 1st job will delete all its data after finishing. The solution is using workspaces in circle_ci. Persisting workspace in the first job and attaching to ws in the latter ones.



_php:7.2fpm uses mariadb, so cant install mysql-client. So either use (default-mysql-client) or (mariadb-client)
